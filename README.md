## More about me
*Hey, my name is Kingsley and Im taking Fanshawe's Interactive Media Design class. I grew up in London and appreciate it enough to take my post secondary here aswell. In my "free time" I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, playing and watching hockey, playing video games and listening to music. I have been to two concerts in my lifetime and seeing my favourite artists The Kid LAROI and DC The Don live was truly amazing and I would recommend everyone to go to a concert atleast once. I have played hockey majority of my life and love seeing my Toronto Maple Leafs loose in the first round every year :(. I enjoy playing games such as Fortnite, Rust, Minecraft and NHL 25. I am trying to get into single player story mode style games but havent found the right one yet. To end off, I was gifted a copy n paste of myself at birth and grew up with my twin brother which was great because I love spending time with my family (of 6) +2 very goofy dogs.*
